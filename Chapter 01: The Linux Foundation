About the Linux Foundation
--------------------------
Since its inception in 1991, Linux has grown to become a major force in computing - powering everything from the New York Stock 
Exchange, to mobile phones, supercomputers, and consumer devices.

The Linux Foundation is a nonprofit organization that sponsors the work of Linux creator Linus Torvalds. It was founded in 2000 
and its mission is to promote, protect, and advance Linux. The Linux Foundation is supported by leading technology companies 
and thousands of individual members from around the world and marshalls the resources of its members and the open source 
development community to ensure that Linux remains free and technically advanced.

The Linux Foundation is active on many fronts. In addition to its basic missions of protecting, promoting and advancing Linux,
the Foundation:

*Produces technical events throughout the world (more on this on the following screen).
*Develops and delivers training programs.
*Hosts major collaborative projects and industry initiatives (Click here to view a video).
*Manages kernel.org where the official versions of the Linux kernel are released.
*Runs the popular website linux.com

The Linux Foundation aims to promote Linux, provide neutral collaboration and education, improve Linux as a technical platform,
and protect and support Linux development. It sponsors the work of Linus Torvalds.

*The Linux Foundation is a nonprofit consortium dedicated to fostering the growth of Linux.
*The Linux Foundation training is for the community and by the community. Linux training is distribution-flexible, technically 
advanced, and created with the leaders of the Linux development community.
*There are three major distribution families within Linux: Fedora, SUSE and Debian. In this course we will work with 
representative members of all of these families throughout.
